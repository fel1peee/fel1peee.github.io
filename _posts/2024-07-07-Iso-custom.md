**Some info on modified ISOs**

A custom iso, is most of the time a windows insanely debloated of ads, irrelevant features, latency hits and other crap software
In the web you can find a lot of these custom iso, but i'll provide someone for you
Additionally, a custom iso is a non-original windows product, so you can install it at you're own risk
You can also try to debloat windows with some program, but to decently do it you'll need a lot of time

In the past, i've used some of these custom iso, and the best one for me are:

- ReviOS 11 23h2 - A lower input latency in fullscreen borderless on modern games, chillest custom ISO around this world, easy to use

- AtlasOS 1803 - Insanely debloated, low latency and customizable. 1803 is the one with the lowest latency. There is also the 20h2 that should give you some fps, and also more compatibility*

**SOME ADVICE**
- A windows custom ISO is for the people that know how to move into it properly, and is not recommended to make other tweaks beyond those already offered by the operating system (except those in this channel, those are basic tweaks that if absent on your PC you can perform without problems)
- Those ISO will certainly have some processes blocked, and that can be a problem for those who play fivem with an anticheat staff (imagine let someone that you don't know check up you're computer in 2024:947496865061023765: )
- Functional brain needed
- Document first about the removed things on those windows!
- Also document first on how to install properly a custom ISO
